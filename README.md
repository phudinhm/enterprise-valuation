# Investment Terminal

A workbench for fundamental equity research: pull a company's reported
financials, value it, compare it with live-matched peers, and export the result
as a self-contained report.

Ported from the [Streamlit original](https://github.com/phudinhm/Company-valuation)
to Next.js so it runs natively on Vercel — same analysis, same explanatory
voice, no Python runtime.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run verify     # 110 checks over the analytics engines
```

Deploying: import the repository on Vercel and accept the defaults. There is
nothing to configure — no API keys, no environment variables, no database.

## Modules

| # | Module | Answers |
|---|--------|---------|
| 00 | Guide & Method | How each module works, and the assumptions behind every calculated figure. |
| 01 | Executive Dashboard | Composite screen, headline metrics, margin and return decomposition, dividends, earnings-quality flags. |
| 02 | Technical Analysis | Trend, momentum, volatility — and a forward projection from three independent methods. |
| 03 | Financial Statements | Reported line items on an Annual, Quarterly or TTM basis, common-size figures beside live industry medians, a line-by-line explanation of every reported item, and a link to the market's primary filing source. |
| 04 | Cash Flow Quality | Whether reported profit turns into cash, and what it costs to keep the business running. |
| 05 | Capital Allocation | ROIC against WACC, incremental return on new capital, and a waterfall of where the cash actually went. |
| 06 | Solvency & Debt | Maturity profile, leverage, interest cover, and a refinancing stress test at higher rates. |
| 07 | Dilution & Owner Earnings | Share-count creep, stock compensation as a share of revenue and cash flow, and free cash flow per share after it. |
| 08 | Intrinsic Valuation | Three-phase DCF, reverse DCF, scenarios, sensitivity grid, cross-method summary. |
| 09 | Peer Comparables | Percentile ranking, growth-versus-valuation regression, peer-implied price ranges. |
| 10 | Compare Companies | Two or more companies side by side: rebased performance, comparison matrix, profile scores, return correlation. |
| 11 | Risk & Scenarios | Volatility, drawdown, value at risk, expected shortfall, Monte Carlo simulation. |
| 12 | Investment Simulator | What a lump sum, or a monthly contribution, invested on a past date would be worth now. |
| 13 | Portfolio | Allocation against policy targets, drift, concentration guardrails, time-weighted and money-weighted return, benchmark comparison. |
| 14 | Price & Capital Dynamics | Price against market cap, an automatically assembled wall of worry, and the enterprise value bridge. |
| 15 | Market Leaders | Cross-company ranking by size and revenue, with three-year trajectories. |

## Coverage

Any listed company on any market the data source can reach. Nothing about the
company universe is bundled with the app:

* **Search** resolves a name or partial symbol live, through the search endpoint
  on both API hosts; when those are throttled the query is probed as a symbol
  across every market suffix in parallel. One rate-limited endpoint cannot make
  a real company look nonexistent.
* **Markets** are selectable for every exchange suffix, from Vietnam's HOSE
  through to Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Nordics.
* **Quotes degrade gracefully.** When the quote endpoint is rate-limited —
  routine on shared serverless hosting — the headline metrics are recomputed
  from the company's own filings, and the page says which figures were computed
  rather than quoted.
* **Two independent backup providers**, neither needing an API key, so they work
  on any deployment without configuration:
  * **Stooq** — daily price history for most developed markets, used whenever
    the primary price endpoint returns nothing.
  * **SEC EDGAR XBRL company facts** — the filings themselves, from the
    regulator, used whenever the primary source returns no financial statements
    for a US filer. Income statement, balance sheet and cash flow are rebuilt
    from the reported XBRL concepts into the same shape the rest of the app
    expects.

  Whichever source answered is named in the provenance panel at the foot of
  every view.
* **Primary sources are linked per market**, with that market's own reporting
  rhythm: SEC EDGAR for the US, HOSE and Vietstock for Vietnam, EDINET for
  Japan, HKEXnews for Hong Kong, and so on.

## How it is built

```
app/            route handlers (the only place that touches the network) + the shell
lib/data/       the data layer: Yahoo, Stooq, SEC EDGAR, and the Company facade
lib/analytics/  the engines: indicators, scoring, valuation, forecast, risk, portfolio
components/     the UI vocabulary, the chart wrapper, and one file per module
scripts/        the verification suite
```

* **All network access is confined to the route handlers** and cached with the
  app's own TTLs through Vercel's data cache: quotes and news 15 minutes,
  statements and FX an hour, SEC filings a day. Moving a slider or switching
  theme never refetches anything.
* **Fan-out fetches run concurrently.** Peer tables, leaderboards and sector
  filters use a bounded-concurrency map rather than a serial loop.
* **Every chart is rendered through one `Figure` component**, which requires a
  numbered caption plus a "what it shows / how to read it / why it matters"
  explanation, and offers the underlying data as CSV.
* **Charts are code-split.** Plotly is a partial bundle — only the trace types
  the terminal draws — imported on demand, so the first load is ~125 kB and the
  guide page downloads no chart code at all.
* **Any view exports** to a standalone HTML report with its charts still
  interactive.
* **The whole view lives in the URL** — company, module, period, basis,
  currency, theme — so any screen is a link you can send to someone.
* **Nothing is stored server-side.** The portfolio table lives in the browser's
  own storage; it is never written to a server.

## Verification

`npm run verify` runs 110 checks over the analytics engines: the DCF against a
hand-computed annuity plus Gordon terminal, the reverse DCF against a growth
rate it must recover, CAPM against its own definition, Altman Z and Piotroski F
against worked examples, XIRR against a one-year round trip, TWRR against
returns measured net of flows, the seeded Monte Carlo for reproducibility, and
the indicator library against series with known answers.

The expected figures are derived from each model's definition, not captured from
a previous run, so a change in behaviour fails rather than silently rebaselining.

## Data and limitations

Coverage is uneven outside the United States, statements are occasionally
restated or misclassified, and some fields are missing entirely for smaller
listings. The app degrades to an explicit "not available" rather than
substituting zero, and states the FX rate applied to every converted figure. A
currency pair that cannot be resolved falls back to the native currency and says
so, rather than silently applying a wrong 1:1 rate.

Verify against primary filings before anything consequential rests on a number
here.
